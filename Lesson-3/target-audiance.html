    </p>
    <p class = 'emmy'>Emmy and her friends are from RiverSide Califnia. Going to the beach is a whole
        day event when ever they do go to the beach because the beach is about 2 hours from their house. 
        Spring break is comong up and they need to know if the weather is going to be ideal. She 
        would hate what happen last time to happen again, it was sunny in Riverside but two 
        hours away it was raining. She needs to check the Sunny Side website to see if what to 
        expect for the weather in San Diego.

    </P>
    <p class = 'carlos'>Carlos is going to have family over this weekend! They have been waiting to come to 
        San Diego because they hear it has a little of everything. But so that his family 
        has the best experiance possible he needs to see what the weather is going to be like
        this weekend. Will the beach be an option? Will a good hike to Torry Pines be good?
        Maybe dirt bikes in the desert sounds like a good idea. Weather is only half the 
        of the eqation, he knows that Labor day weekends are usually some times whe they are 
        busy all over the place. Luckly Sunny Side has been recording history for a long time with 
        algorithims that predict the traffic of people in different parts of San Diego with times
        that are most busy.
