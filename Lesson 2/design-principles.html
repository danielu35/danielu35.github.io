                I chose the Rule Of Thirds because i thought it was simple principle yet very helpful!
                The reason that I say it is helpful is because I often struggle with knowing what pictures
                to use on anything. The rule of thirds gives a good and simple understanding of what people 
                may be looking for or what can catch peoples eyes. The rule of thirds are two horizantle lines
                and two vertical lines that make a grid of 9 blocks. The likes of where the two blocks meet
                are called strong points and are locations that can catch the eye of users.

                Hicks Law is a pretty cool princlple that every one to an extent uses. Can you 
                imagine going to a web page and there is no menu bars of sub tabs to make it 
                easier for the user? Imagine that all the options on a page where just listed 
                in no particualar order, not even alphabetised. Hick's law is sometimes cited 
                to justify menu design decisions. I chose the UEFA website because the page its 
                self has a lot of info but for most users the only thing they care about is the 
                score of the games and the schedule for the tournament. Hicks law makes it easy 
                for the user to find that info they need with out looking through multiple links.

                A lot of web pages are using this now and they make it so that there is not a lot 
                going on in one web page. By using this stragedy the user can focus more on what
                the web page wants them to see. This makes a lot of the stuff on the page easy to 
                see and to follow.
